# Claude Code — Global Rules

Precise autonomous coding agent. Research before build. Verify before done.

## Core Workflow

- **Research first**: read existing code before write new. Understand before change.
- **Test before commit**: run tests local. Never commit broken code.
- **Verify before done**: show evidence (build output, test results, lsp_diagnostics) before claim done.
- **Smallest viable change**: match complexity to task. No scope broaden.
- **Parallel when independent**: independent tool calls in same message.
- **Match codebase patterns**: naming, error handling, imports — read before write.
- **No debug leftovers**: grep `console.log`, `TODO`, `debugger`, `pdb.set_trace` before finish.
- **Prefer dedicated tools**: Glob/Grep/Read over Bash find/grep/cat.
- **Use Bun.$ for shell**: prefer `Bun.$` over raw `exec` in TypeScript.
- **Explore first on multi-file**: Glob to map, Grep to find, Read to understand.

## Coding Style

- **No comments unless critical**. Code readable by reading. Comment only WHY for: hidden constraint, subtle invariant, bug workaround, non-obvious trade-off. Never WHAT (names do that). Never history ("added for X", "fixes #123"). Never task refs.
- **Clean + optimized**: no dead code, no speculative abstractions, no premature generics, no stale imports. Delete > deprecate. Reuse existing helpers before writing new.
- **Self-documenting names**: verbs for functions, nouns for data, full words not abbrevs. `userEmail` not `ue`, `deployHooks` not `dh`.
- **Smallest surface**: one function = one concern. Extract only when reused 3+. Prefer pure functions. Trust internal code — validate at boundaries only.
- **No dead defense**: no try/catch for impossible cases, no fallbacks for inputs you control, no error-swallow. Let errors bubble when caller should handle.

## Research First — auto-triggered MCP use (non-negotiable)

Training cutoff ≠ current state. Before writing code that touches a library, framework, external API, or open-source repo, Claude MUST call the relevant MCP. Not "consider". Call.

| Trigger (detect in user's request or target code) | Action (auto, no user ask) |
|---|---|
| Library/package name is mentioned (`react`, `bun`, `polars`, `axum`, any `import`/`require`/`use` statement added) | `mcp__docfork__search_docs` THEN `fetch_doc` on top result BEFORE writing the code |
| User reports lib bug, unexpected lib behavior, or asks "does X support Y" | `mcp__deepwiki__ask_question` on the repo — check upstream semantics FIRST |
| User mentions a GitHub repo, PR, issue, release, tag, or wants to verify upstream state | `mcp__github__*` tools (cross-repo) or `gh` CLI (single repo) |
| Task touches DB schema, SQL, query performance | `psql` / `mongosh` / project ORM CLI directly — no DB MCP installed |
| Task is a security review, dep scan, CVE check, SAST/SCA/IaC | `mcp__Snyk__snyk_code_scan` / `snyk_sca_scan` / `snyk_iac_scan` automatically |
| Task asks "did we solve this before?", "what's the history of X?", "how did we do Y last time?" | `mcp__plugin_claude-mem_mcp-search__smart_search` FIRST before exploring code |
| Task touches a SaaS integration (Slack, Linear, Gmail, Notion, etc.) | `mcp__composio__*` via `COMPOSIO_LIST_TOOLKITS` → `INITIATE_CONNECTION` |
| Task asks about symbol impact, cross-module refs, rename safety | `mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols` BEFORE editing |

Local tool still first when a 1-line CLI does it (`Read`, `Grep`, `gh`, `bun`, `uv`). MCP when it saves tokens or reaches external state the CLI can't.

**Verification loop rule**: for every library claim (API shape, flag, version behavior) Claude states, either (a) cite the docfork/deepwiki result inline OR (b) note "unverified, training-cutoff" and call the MCP before finalizing. Unsourced lib claims = lint failure.

### Skill-before-code rule (3-tier model)

Before writing any procedure that *could* exist as a reusable skill (browser automation, CI config, OAuth flow, file format parsing, test harness, deployment recipe, etc.), check each tier in order:

1. **Tier 1 — user-global base** (`~/.claude/skills/`): always-on baseline. Contains our 17 custom skills + skills.sh seed bundle (`find-skills`, `caveman`, `karpathy-guidelines`, `playwright-cli`). If a match exists here, use it.
2. **Tier 2 — project-scoped auto-seed** (`<project>/.claude/skills/`): stack-aware skills installed by `autoskills` when the project was first opened. If the user just entered a fresh project with no `.claude/skills/` dir, run `npx autoskills -y` (scans `package.json` / Gradle / configs → installs matching skills.sh bundle + writes project `CLAUDE.md`). Covers React, Next.js, Prisma, Stripe, Playwright, Clerk, Supabase, Go, Bun, Deno, Kotlin, Flutter, Terraform, etc. — ~30 curated stacks.
3. **Tier 3 — on-demand via `find-skills`**: if the task needs a capability not in Tier 1/2 (niche API wrapper, obscure CLI, etc.), activate `find-skills` to search skills.sh's full 90k-skill catalog. Install with `npx skills add <owner/repo> --skill <name> -g -y` (use `-g` for user scope when the skill is reusable across projects, drop `-g` when it's project-specific).
4. Only write custom skill logic when all three tiers fail (no existing skill covers the task or all candidates are weaker). Custom skills live in this repo's `skills/` dir and ship with the installer.

Rule of thumb: local tool first (`Read`, `Grep`, `gh`, `bun`, `uv`); Tier 1 for always-on skills; Tier 2 for new projects; Tier 3 for surprise gaps.

### Proactive follow-up offers

After completing the primary task, Claude MUST end its reply with a single-line offer for ANY follow-up skill that would add obvious value. Not a pitch — a yes/no prompt. User decides. Examples:

| Task just finished | Proactive offer (append as one line) |
|---|---|
| Shipped a UI component / page / form | *"Want me to generate Playwright E2E tests (`playwright-cli` skill)?"* |
| Fixed a bug | *"Want me to add a regression test that pins this fix (`tdd-first`)?"* |
| Wrote core logic / algorithm | *"Want me to write tests first next time? Or add them now (`tdd-first`)?"* |
| Touched authentication / crypto / uploads / untrusted input | *"Want me to run a security pass (`security-audit` + `snyk_code_scan`)?"* |
| Edited a CI workflow / Dockerfile / deploy script | *"Want me to run `ci-hygiene` for pinned-version + secrets audit?"* |
| Public-facing change (CLI flag, API signature, README) | *"Want me to update docs (`doc-hygiene`)?"* |
| Refactor landed | *"Want me to run `simplify` skill + `code-simplifier` agent for a polish pass?"* |
| Session produced new patterns worth remembering | *"Want me to capture this to `tasks/lessons.md` / claude-mem (`do-recorder`)?"* |
| Any feature with runtime dependencies I haven't verified | *"Want me to boot the app in a browser and smoke-test it (`playwright-cli`)?"* |

Format: one line, ends with `?`. No bullet list, no "would you like". Never more than two offers per turn. Silent when no follow-up fits.

## Skills + MCPs

Skills own MCP routing. Don't duplicate the list here.

- Route coding work through `/do` (front-door skill). It classifies → dispatches to sub-skill (`ship-feature` / `fix-bug` / `refactor-safely` / `security-audit` / `onboard-codebase`).
- Each sub-skill declares which MCPs / subagents / tools it uses. Read the SKILL.md before second-guessing.
- General rule: local tool first (`Read`, `Grep`, `gh`, `bun`, `uv`), MCP only when it saves tokens or reaches external state the CLI can't.

## Safety Rules

Critical rules enforced by hooks + `settings.json` — run 100%. This file advisory ~80%. Hooks block. No bypass, no work-around.

## Tool Guidance

- `lsp_diagnostics` after every file edit — catch type errors before claim done.
- `ast_grep_search` for structural patterns.
- `serena` for semantic types + cross-module refs.
- `gh` CLI for GitHub ops (no MCP token overhead).
- Browser automation / E2E tests: activate `Skill("playwright-cli")` — pure CLI (40+ commands), 4× fewer tokens than the MCP variant. No playwright MCP installed by design.

## Self-Improvement

Read `tasks/lessons.md` at session start if exists. Every correction → `tasks/lessons.md`. Never repeat same mistake.
