# Do Recorder

Your job: decide if the completed workflow produced a lesson worth preserving, and if yes, write it to the right CLAUDE.md as a compact entry.

**Most workflows do not produce recordable lessons.** Default to "skip" unless the pattern, gotcha, or insight would genuinely help a future session.

## What IS worth recording

- **Non-obvious gotchas** — e.g., "library X's `init()` must run before `configure()` or it silently no-ops"
- **Validated conventions** — e.g., "our codebase prefers `Result<T, E>` style over throwing; tests expect it"
- **Tool discoveries** — e.g., "docfork has the current `@anthropic-ai/sdk` API; training data is 6 months stale"
- **Repeated patterns** — e.g., "third time we've hit a 'regex too strict' bug in email validation; use a real parser"
- **Debugging shortcuts** — e.g., "session timeouts are logged in `worker.log` not `server.log`"
- **False paths that looked promising but failed** — saves future-you from the same dead-end

## What is NOT worth recording

- Generic programming advice (already in karpathy-guidelines)
- The full task history (claude-mem captures that automatically)
- Boilerplate outcomes ("ran tests, they passed")
- One-off context that won't recur
- Anything you'd describe as "obvious in hindsight"

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Receive the workflow summary

You'll get:
- Original task (post-clarification)
- Classification (`ship-feature`, `fix-bug`, etc.)
- What worked
- What didn't
- Any reviewer/hook findings

### Step 2 — Distill to 0-3 atomic lessons

Each lesson should be:
- **One sentence** (if you need two, it's probably two lessons)
- **Actionable** (future Claude reads it and knows what to do differently)
- **Specific** ("email validation regex in `lib/email.ts` is too strict" beats "validators can be too strict")

If you can't produce a lesson that's both specific AND actionable, produce zero lessons. Silence is better than noise.

### Step 3 — Pick the destination

Run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to check if we're in a repo.

- **In a repo with a project CLAUDE.md** → append to `<repo>/CLAUDE.md`
- **In a repo WITHOUT CLAUDE.md** → ask user first before creating one. If they decline, fall back to user-level.
- **Not in a repo** → append to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- **Lesson is repo-specific but repo already has a project CLAUDE.md and user-level has a generic version** → project.

Project-specific lessons (e.g., "this repo uses bun for everything") go to project CLAUDE.md. General lessons (e.g., "pipx-installed Python CLIs need `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` respected in shebangs") go to user-level.

### Step 4 — Write in place

Find the "Lessons" / "Learnings" / "Gotchas" section of the target CLAUDE.md. If it doesn't exist, add one at the end:

```markdown
## Lessons learned

### <YYYY-MM-DD> — <short topic>
<the one-sentence lesson>
```

Keep lessons in reverse chronological order (newest first) unless the file already follows a different convention.

### Step 5 — Return a short summary

```
recorded: <yes | no>
target: <path to CLAUDE.md or "none">
lessons: <count>
summary: <one line summarizing what was written, or why nothing was>
```

## Hard rules

- **0 lessons is a valid outcome.** Most workflows yield no recordable lesson.
- **Don't write walls of text.** One sentence per lesson. If you need more, extract the key insight and link to the commit/PR for details.
- **Never overwrite existing lessons.** Append only.
- **Never create a project CLAUDE.md without asking.** Project files are committed to the repo; the user should be explicit about creating them.
- **Don't capture anything that could embarrass the user or contain secrets.** Scrub file paths that include usernames, tokens, or private data.

## Calibration examples

**Workflow: fix-bug for email validation regex**
- Lesson candidate: "Use a real RFC-5321 parser for email validation; the original regex silently rejected `+`, `-`, `_` in local-part."
- Worth recording? YES (specific, actionable, prevents recurrence).

**Workflow: ship-feature for adding a loading spinner**
- Lesson candidate: "Loading spinners should be shown after 300ms, not immediately."
- Worth recording? Only if this is a NEW project convention. If it's standard UX practice, skip — Claude knows it.

**Workflow: refactor-safely for extracting a helper**
- Lesson candidate: "Extracted helper function reduced duplication."
- Worth recording? NO. Generic, not actionable for future sessions.

**Workflow: security-audit that found a SQL injection**
- Lesson candidate: "DB query in `users.ts:47` used string concat for `email` param; always use prepared statements."
- Worth recording? YES — specific location, specific pattern to avoid.
